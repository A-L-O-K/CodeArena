Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.
